[16:15:02] SOL/USDC | jupiter@0.008822 → raydium@0.003801 | spread -56.91% | profit 1.20% (120bps)
[16:15:01] SOL/USDC | raydium@0.004879 → jupiter@0.000537  | spread +89.00% | profit 0.85% (85bps)
[16:14:58] SOL/USDC | jupiter@0.003708 → raydium@0.004368  | spread +17.82% | profit 0.50% (50bps)

📊 Stats: 20 opportunities | Avg: 0.75% | Best: 2.30%
```

## 💡 How It Works

### 🔍 Data Sources
- **Jupiter Aggregator API** - Cross-DEX price quotes
- **Raydium API** - Direct AMM pricing
- **Orca API** - Concentrated liquidity data
- **Phoenix API** - Central limit order book

### ⚙️ Detection Algorithm
1. **Fetch** - Streams real-time prices from multiple DEXs
2. **Normalize** - Unifies price formats and pair naming
3. **Calculate** - Computes spreads and net profit estimates
4. **Filter** - Removes opportunities below profit threshold
5. **Display** - Shows profitable opportunities in real-time

### 🎯 Opportunity Scoring
Each opportunity shows:
- **Pair** - Trading pair (e.g., SOL/USDC)
- **DEX Route** - Buy DEX → Sell DEX
- **Prices** - Exact prices on each DEX
- **Spread %** - Raw price difference
- **Profit %** - Net profit after estimated fees
- **Basis Points** - Profit in trading units (100 bps = 1%)

## 📊 Understanding Output

### Color Coding
- 🟢 **Green**: High-profit opportunities (>1%)
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Medium-profit opportunities (0.5-1%)
- 🔴 **Red**: Low-profit opportunities (0.1-0.5%)

### Example Output Breakdown
```
[16:15:02] SOL/USDC | jupiter@0.008822 → raydium@0.003801 | spread -56.91% | profit 1.20% (120bps)
```
- `16:15:02` - Detection timestamp
- `SOL/USDC` - Trading pair
- `jupiter@0.008822` - Buy on Jupiter at price 0.008822
- `raydium@0.003801` - Sell on Raydium at price 0.003801
- `spread -56.91%` - Price difference between DEXs
- `profit 1.20%` - Estimated net profit after fees
- `(120bps)` - Profit in basis points

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

### 🎓 Educational Purpose Only
SpreadNet is designed for **educational and research purposes**:
- **Does NOT execute trades automatically**
- **Does NOT provide financial advice**
- **Does NOT guarantee profitable outcomes**
- **Use for learning and market analysis only**

### 💰 Trading Risks
Arbitrage trading involves significant risks:
- **Market Volatility** - Prices change rapidly
- **Execution Risk** - Opportunities may disappear instantly
- **Slippage** - Actual prices may differ from quotes
- **Gas Fees** - Transaction costs can eliminate profits
- **MEV Competition** - Bots may capture opportunities first
- **Liquidity Risk** - Large trades may move markets

### 🔒 Security Best Practices
- **Never share private keys** with any software
- **Use testnet first** to understand mechanics
- **Start with small amounts** when testing
- **Monitor network congestion** and gas prices
- **Understand impermanent loss** in LP strategies

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Modify Detection Parameters
Edit `spreadnet.py` to customize:

```python
# Minimum profit threshold (in %)
self.min_profit_threshold = 0.1  # Default: 0.1%

# Detection frequency
await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Default: 2 seconds

# DEX endpoints
self.dex_configs = {
    # Add/remove DEXs here
}
```

### Add New DEXs
To monitor additional DEXs:
1. Add API endpoint to `dex_configs`
2. Implement price fetching method
3. Update price combination logic

## 🎯 Expected Performance

### Typical Metrics
- **Detection Speed**: <1 second from price change
- **Opportunities/Hour**: 20-100 (market dependent)
- **Average Profit**: 0.3-1.5% per opportunity
- **False Positive Rate**: <10% with default filters

### Market Conditions Impact
- **High Volatility**: More opportunities, higher profits
- **Low Volatility**: Fewer opportunities, smaller spreads
- **Network Congestion**: Slower execution, higher costs
- **Trading Hours**: Peak activity increases competition

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Connection Error"**
- Check internet connection
- Verify API endpoints are accessible
- Some DEX APIs may have rate limits

**"No Opportunities Found"**
- Normal during low volatility periods
- Try lowering `min_profit_threshold`
- Check if DEX APIs are responding

**High CPU Usage**
- Increase sleep interval between checks
- Reduce number of monitored pairs
- Monitor system resources

### Performance Tips
- **Stable Internet**: Use wired connection for best results
- **Close Other Apps**: Free up system resources
- **Regular Restarts**: Restart every 24 hours for optimal performance

## 📋 Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **aiohttp library**
- **Stable internet connection**
- **4GB+ RAM recommended**
